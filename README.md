# POLYNOMIAL-REGRESSION
**📌 Project Overview**

This project implements Polynomial Regression to model the relationship between a job position level and its corresponding salary.

Unlike simple linear regression, this project demonstrates how polynomial regression can better capture non-linear relationships in data.

**📂 Dataset Information**

Dataset File: Position_Salaries.csv
Number of Records: 10
Number of Columns: 3

**🔹 Columns Description**

Column Name	Description
Position	Job title
Level	Position level (Independent Variable)
Salary	Salary corresponding to the position (Dependent Variable)

**🔹 Variables Used in Model**

X (Independent Variable): Level

y (Dependent Variable): Salary

The "Position" column is not used in model training.

**🎯 Objective**

To:

Compare Linear Regression vs Polynomial Regression

Demonstrate why linear regression is insufficient for non-linear salary growth

Build a polynomial regression model for accurate salary prediction

**⚙️ Technologies & Libraries Used**

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

**📌 Conclusion**

This project demonstrates:

The limitation of Linear Regression in non-linear datasets

The effectiveness of Polynomial Regression in modeling curved relationships

How feature transformation improves model performance

Polynomial Regression (degree 4) provides a much better fit for predicting salaries based on position level.
